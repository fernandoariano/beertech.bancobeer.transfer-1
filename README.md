# How to test locally
- Java 8 / Maven / your favourite IDE / Git
- Ports 8080 and 8081 must be available
- Clone the repo @ https://github.com/victorhrgc/beertech.bancobeer.git
- 'docker-compose up' in the root directory to start the postgres and the rabbit container
- Login into rabbit, go to the 'Queues' tab to add a new queue named 'rk.consumer.rabbitmq'

- Start both the API and the Consumer applications on your IDE ('BancoBeerApiApplication.java' and 'BancoBeerConsumerApplication.java')

- Use swagger to create accounts and check the balance of a certain account

- Post a message on the rabbit queue to execute transactions


# How to post a message on the rabbit queue
- Go to queues and click on your recently created queue
- Go to the Publish Message section and add a payload with the following structure: {"operation":"", "value":"", "originAccountCode":"", "destinationAccountCode":""}
- Operations can be (T/D/S)


# Possible errors and how to handle them
- If you get a Flyway error about the Postgres password, its probably because you have another version of postgres installed, try uninstalling it and running through docker only.
